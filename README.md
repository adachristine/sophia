# sophia
uefi bootloader and kernel for x64

this code sucks and should not be used under any circumstances

whoever is outside my house yelling "comment your code!" i will never comment my code

## how to use

in order to use this you will require the following:

- clang 9.0+
- qemu supporting x86\_64
- an OVMF installation usable as a firmware for qemu

generally it is only currently possible to build from a POSIX-like system.
this is not a rule, but i do not currently support any other means

## how to contribute

if my project has somehow piqued your interest and you'd like to contribute,
please feel free to create your own fork and send a PR.

## sophia copyright notice

i maintain no copyright over any of this. i don't care. this is a passion project
and not something i ever expect to be worth the time or effort to plagairize or
be worth anything commercially. good luck if you think so, though. your estimation
of the quality of my code and ability as a programmer are clearly much higher than
my own.

my attorney has advised me to also include the following copyright notices but
idek what she's talking about half the time
